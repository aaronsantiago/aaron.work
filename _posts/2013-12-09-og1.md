_og1_ is a project centered around an Instagram account: [@\_og\_one](https://www.instagram.com/_og_one/)  
_og1_ was the creation of a streamlined identity: og1's moniker contains only three characters to represent its brand. The "[OG](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=OG) one" is a being of uniqueness and originality incarnate.  
This project trades the expression of personal concepts for the impact of polish and pandering. It is at once a way to share work with friends and a construction of a self that positions itself above others. Though the account features many polished, narcissistic images of its protagonist (as any good Insta should), it sets itself apart by making clear the time and effort invested in its content. What should generally be considered obscene, the days and weeks invested into a single post, question the platform's users in a playful way: Who are you posing as? How hard is it to be you? How much control does the platform have over your self-image?
