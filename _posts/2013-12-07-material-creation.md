When constructing digital works, detail is a constant struggle. Pixel-perfect control comes with the burden of millions of pixels to fill. Many digital works turn to digital sampling of textures and imagers to acquire detail made by others, or use generative techniques to allow computers to add digital detail automatically. Physical artists, however, have long enjoyed the ability to leverage nature and its endless supply of detail. Opulence is a series of works that study the aesthetics of detail and attempt to create feelings of fullness while escaping the limitations of total control.

The flagship piece, _Procedure Maximal_, was created using long pieces of wire that were coated in paint, bundled, and whipped against a canvas made of pages torn from a design magazine, creating a composition with deceptive amounts of aesthetic depth. Variations in wire handling account for the different textures present in the work.
