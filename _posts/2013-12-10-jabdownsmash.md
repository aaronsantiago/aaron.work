_jabdownsmash_ was an exercise in unfettered expression.  Each page on jabdownsmash.com attempted to create snapshots of my life by restricting the time from ideation to publishing to one or two days. I estimate that the median time of construction for these pages was 5 - 6 hours.  
This body of work draws heavily from my practice in game jams and hackathons. These are timed coding competitions where work is ideated and developed from scratch in a small number of days, usually over a weekend. Refining the ability to design and execute small ideas allowed each page to become true-to-life.
