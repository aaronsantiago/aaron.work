This work, titled *Yearning to be Known: A Zoom Ritual Experience*, used the annotation tools inside Zoom to allow participants to anonymously express their thoughts and feelings to one another.
Participants were guided into a space where care was taken to ensure they felt safe and present.
The session was held with live visuals and piano accompaniment.
