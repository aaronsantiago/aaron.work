The Golden Key is an endlessly told fairy tale from the future made in response to audience input. Made in collaboration with Matthew Niederhauser and Marc Da Costa.

THE GOLDEN KEY immerses visitors in the mythical fantasies of an artificially intelligent machine as it composes a never ending story. The work imagines a future world that has endured the severest impacts of climate change. THE GOLDEN KEY is an artifact, a time capsule, a provocation that was left behind in the last days of the old world. It invites participants to reconstruct a lost mythological history by interacting with digital prompts displayed on the exhibition floor. As the narrative progresses, a flowing sequence of stories, visuals, and audio is created by combining visitors' input with an AI system built on tens of thousands of folktales from across the old world, a range of narrative fragments reflecting our most fundamental concerns.

The Golden Key won the XR Jury Award at SXSW 2024.
