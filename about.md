I'm Aaron. I have a history with software development and game design, and I am enamored with the gift of the recently-possible. My practice can be best described as seeking mastery over the educated guess; I explore a broad variety of mediums such as visual art, music, dance, game development, and new media art in an attempt to elevate my work with advanced technology.
